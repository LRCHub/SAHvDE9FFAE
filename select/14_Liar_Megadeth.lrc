[00:31.46] You take great pride in never having lived up to anything
[00:36.59] Lie, steal, cheat, and kill, a real bad guy
[00:40.92] Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy's quite insane
[00:45.68] From altar boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn
[01:10.68] 
[00:50.28] Your sister is a junkie, gets it anyway she can
[00:55.06] Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band
[00:59.63] Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your Hep and AIDS
[01:04.23] There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet
[01:32.23] 
[01:19.54] Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes
[01:24.27] Your face is replaced, a creature you despise
[01:28.95] But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid
[01:33.79] I know you'll be lying until your dying day
[01:55.29] 
[01:38.68] Make up your stories, truth's so hard to say
[01:43.43] Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave
[01:48.36] Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's disease
[01:50.80] And decadence and debauchery killed your memories
[02:15.30] 
[01:58.07] You're a liar, liar, liar!
[02:01.68] Everyone can see
[02:02.91] You're a liar, liar, liar!
[02:06.27] It's all you'll ever be
[02:07.60] You're a liar, liar, liar!
[02:10.75] It's what you mean to me
[02:12.64] Liar, liar, lies!
[02:21.14] 
[02:17.35] Start trouble, spread pain, piss and venom, in your veins
[02:19.77] Talk nasty, breathe fire, smell rotten, you're a liar
[02:21.97] Sweat liquor, breathe snot, eat garbage, spit blood
[02:24.34] Diseased, health hazard, scum bag, filthy bastard
[02:48.84] 
[02:26.77] Greasy face, teeth decay, hair matted, drunk all day
[02:29.57] Abscessed, sunken veins, rot gut, scrambled brains
[02:31.48] Steal money, crash cars, rob jewelry, hock guitars
[02:33.83] Rot in Hell, it's time you know, to your master, off you go
[03:03.33] 
[02:38.93] You're a liar!
[02:43.48] A fucking liar!
[02:48.46] Filthy liar!
[02:54.82] Liar...
[02:58.32] 
[03:00.27] Ah, you, you, you fucking liar!
[03:15.77] 
[03:05.12] You're a liar!
