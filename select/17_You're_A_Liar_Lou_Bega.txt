Did you ever see a girl like her
If you say yes you're a liar I swear
There's no one else that compares to her
Cause she is my my my my girl
She's the kinda lady at best you can't describe
When you meet & greet she makes you wanna ride her
Meet her mom meet her papa meet her dog
Just greet everyone who's in her life just be soft
Did you ever meet a girl like her
If you say yes you're a liar I swear
There's no one else that compares to her
She's is my my my my girl
Look into her eyes look into her deep soul
She's got that swagger that can gain control
Kick down her door baby girl I want more
Have you ever felt like this before
Did you ever kiss a girl like her
If you say yes you're a liar I swear
There's no one else that compares to her
She's is my my my my girl
Love is in the air love is everywhere
Kisses are exchanged but the rate is unfair
Nobody's better than the one I got
Should I trust my perception or should I not
Did you ever trust a girl like her
If you say yes you're a liar I swear
There's no one else that compares to her
She's is my my my my girl
Now I'm liying in the shades and I ask myself
She's too good to be true do I kill my health
So I roll with the punches just like every day
I just wanna know how I feel about it... anyway
Did you ever love a girl like her
If you say yes you're a liar I swear
There's no one else that compares to her
Cause she is my my my my my girl
Cause she is my my my my girl
She is my my my my girl
She is my girl she is my my girl.
End
